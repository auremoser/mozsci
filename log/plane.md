Dearest Fellows!

Thank you so much for spending a glorious week with us in Cape Town. I'm not alone in being so proud of you, which is possibly the least illustrious honor of your exciting year with the science lab! But I can confirm with confidence that you were the best fellows for the job, and there are few things more satisfying than feeling validated in that perspective after 10 months talking/traveling with and learning from you. 

NO REGRETS

Together we...

* mastered Github, became the oligarchical mayors of etherpad via over 20 bi-weekly checkins, designed the infamous all-science floor at Mozfest 2016, coordinated a 48hr global hackathon, mentored 8+ open source project leads, learned how to pick locks, made zines, marched for science, rescued data, published preprints and pre-pretty prints++ (AKA blogs), read and tweeted about 4 rounds of #openscience books, co-facilitated 5 community calls, secured a couple of PhDs, locked-in even more fellowships, planned and executed 5 WOWs in 4 countries, and brought in a staggering 1050 applicants for fellowship round 3

On top of that, we led semi-normal lives!

More recently, we...

* ran a kickass Cape Town [WOW](https://mozillascience.github.io/WOW-SA/) with community members from 6 countries!
* wrapped up a 10-month journey across 3-ish timezones that brought us together in Toronto, London, San Francisco, Cape Town, Lisbon? and spanned too many personal and professional trajectories to count
* tried to get to Robben Island http://www.robben-island.org.za/tours
* explored Table Mountain and took a real-estate speculation tour of Cape Town
* #mozvan'd to Boulder Beach for snaps of penguins
* followed baboons up a FUNicular to a lighthouse, and logged at least 3,000 steps on the way down

I could go on forever, and I will...

NEVER FORGET

For now...

* wrap up your resumes and push me a PR to merge into master
* submit all June expenses, including Cape Town, before July 7, 2017
* [non-US folks] record all fellowship-related US travel here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ka9uoSvx7xlK4z8N1Vkm5xDUFLQ90_u_ssMQ66LMByQ/edit#gid=85710639 
* submit at least one mozfest proposal: https://mozillafestival.org/proposals
* think about that closing blog post: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/2017-fellows-offboarding#lineNumber=431
* write yourselves [a good bio](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwzRIYyom644STdadllXaGVibHc) and update your Linked'In
* sign up for an exit interview with Aurelia: 

There were some epic tweets this week @MozillaScience + #mozwow, and Bruno photgraphed the begeezus out of this trip, check out his [photos](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPRh4R_mrIme8o9UsHnTz307eZ70URmBv8kjqL4P92eNPXqEoN3IHIqqr2Ga2y4Cg?key=Tk41VXBSY0E5VEdLUElrZFRNOUY1bFZLbTl2T2NB) and add the overflow ones to this thread!

Here are some jams from our car ride to the Cape: 

You are my favorite people to (almost) escape the room with; safe travels home and see you at #Mozfest!

(WOW list)

Hello WOW participants, 
I hope this message finds you well and recovered from our two-day Working Open Workshop in Cape Town. We were so delighted to have you join us, and hope to involve you in future events and opportunities to share about your open science work and communities.

For now, here are a few ways to keep involved:

READ THE DOCS
We documented our activities over the two days, feel free to review the materials, remix and reuse them for future workshops! Let us know if you have any questions or need help!
