**ABOUT RDA**

The Research Data Alliance (RDA) is an international initiative that was launched as a community-driven organization at the first RDA Plenary in Gothenburg, Sweden, in March 2013 by the European Commission, the United States National Science Foundation and National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Australian Government’s Department of Innovation with the goal of building the social and technical infrastructure to enable open sharing of data.

### NOTES
* great keynote from "RDA – a bottom-up initiative?" - ‎Augusto Burgueño Arjona, Head of the Unit "eInfrastructure & Science Cloud" at European Commission's Directorate 
* focused on the 6,000 projects funded over the next 7 years by the EU and how to engage them in RDA

* **SESSION 1: IG on Domain Repositories**
	* treat data management and software sustainability on equal footing
	* Stakeholder roles and tasks: governments, funding parties, science + societies, executive organizations
	* domain-oriented approach that advocates a single plan for all users/roles
	* data protocols framework: minimum conditions, laws and regulations, templates, examples, standards, support resources
	* the core ideas:
		* make life easier for researchers - signle generally approved model
		* make life easier for funders - only need to check applications with a pre-defined protocol
	* From open to fair data - path to open access, 10 years of work
	* mantra: "as open as possible, as closed as needed"
	* ord pilot
	* FAIR Data Management DMP - light and flexible, one dmp per project, a living document - participant portal
	* open research data pilot
	* data hubs MPGDL, datahub.io, ADS (astronomy), CERN (high-energy physics, Github (software)
	* open science is a trend, science has to open up to be reproducible and communicate with the public - we definitely need a datamanagement plan
	* **biosharing.org**
	* CLARIN - "comomon language resources and technology infrastructure" - digital language data and advanced tools to discover, explore, exploit, annotate, analyse or combine them
	* **problem** funder templates and institutional templates, maybe asking institutuions to contribute to existing questions rather than come up with their own (re: dmp)

* **SESSION 2: IG on Education and Training on handling of research data**
	* **projects**:
		* EOSCpilot Project and training on Open Science  - Kevin AShley
			* European Open Science Cloud Pilot
			* **http://eoscpilot.eu/**
		* FOSTER Plus Project - Eloy Rodrigues
			** Fosting the Practical Implementation of Open Science (starts May 1st)
			* being used in colombia currently, more than 100 face2face training events in 28 countries, 6,000+ participants
			* working with 3 disciplinary communities: Life Sciences (ELIXIR), Social Sciences (CESSDA), Humanities (DARIAH)
			* 900000 euro budget
			* developing an open science toolkit, and training handbook
			* **www.fosteropenscience.eu**
		* GO FAIR initiative
		* EDISON
		* Research Data Management
* **SESSION 3: IG on GEospatial**
	* SPACETIME
		* earth server - focused on datacubes, mostly weather data and satellite imagery
		* **http://standards.rasdaman.com/**
		* **http://earthserver.eu/**
		* rasdaman: scalable array engine for spatio-temporal regular and irrecular grids
		* ogc coverages - ogc + iso + INSPIRE std bodies
	* Cross-domain re-use of geospatial information: INSPIRE
		* providing access to cross-border EU data to be used in support to environmental policies or activities which impact enfironment
		* DCAT-AP - data cataloge application profitel for european data portals
