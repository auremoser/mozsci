####TITLE

Small data slippy maps: clever methods + curious geometries in JS geo

####SUMMARY

The meaning of "map" across disciplines is remarkably varied. It's effectively a spatial representation of geo-topography, a linking between tables by foreign key, a datatype in C++... Today, coders make creative use of custom basemaps, building remarkable maps of multivariate information off-the-(beaten) geographic projection. Many have designed and published interactive maps of cemetery burial plots, galactic drawings of the Star Wars Universe, sequence maps of human genes, heatmaps of court traffic during the NBA finals, multivarite maps of environmental sensor data. For some of the most creative maps, "artisanal" CSV data is the vehicle for innovation in geocoding to non-traditional, historical, handmade basemaps. This talk will explore artisanal mapping in JS, detailing how to map them, how use SQL and JS to manipulate them, and how to structure data to suit them.

####BIO

Aurelia is a developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at the Mozilla Science Lab. Previously of Ushahidi, Internews Kenya, and CartoDB, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South. She also runs a radio show based on the Semantic Web, called [Stereo Semantics](http://www.stereosemantics.com/), and co-hosts a show-and-tell meetup called [That Belongs in A Museum](http://thatbelongsinamuseum.nyc/)
