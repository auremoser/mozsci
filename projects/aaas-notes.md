AAAS Notes

* 20 fellows, 18 reg, 2 staff
* 8 phds, 8 masters (2 non science)
* lots of partners, trellis as 

## Schedule
* each day has an overarching theme
* not every session might apply to your role
* you'll have a plan for your day job by the end
* common ground: opening/closing circles, lightning talks, reflection space, mentor checkins every day with worksheet #CEFP2017 as hashtag, go long for discussion topics that extend beyond time alotted
* ribbons for staff, mentors and trainers as IDs
* documenting in google docs and trellis (Trellis>library/google drive folders)

## Exercises

## Monday
### CR Session

* Community Management Fundamentals

	* who engages and how
	* how communities form and evolve
	* how network structure impacts outcomes
	* aggregate behaviors and culture
	* how to reward behavior
	* **community** = A group of people with unique shared values, behaviors and artifacts
	* major community types:
	'''
	the more academic and credentialed organizations are, the harder it is to develop an open culture"
	'''
	* communities are networks of relationships not just content sharing - more like a graph, not a centralized network
	* Management techniques: hierarchy, emergent community, community, networked
	* 5 elements important to community members
		* develop community programs ot increase connection, trust, and desired behaviors
	* Share out loud model
		* validate out loud, share out loud, ask and answers out loud, explore out loud

* Profiling Community Members
* Shared purpose and Shared Value
* Key Behaviors
* Translating Strategy to Action

## Wednesday
### Science of Team Science (SCITS)

* Kara l. Hall, Team Science and Collaboration Planning
* collaboration is complex : mulit-level, multi-factoial, interacting influences
* continuum of disciplinary integration
	* transdisciplinary - different disciplines work jointly 
	* multidisciplinary - different disciplines work sequentially in own disciplines
	* interdisciplinary - different disciplines work jointly 
	* unidisciplinary - one discipline
* developing translational tools - the toolbox
* **dimensions of teams: diversity, integration, size, proximity**
* collaboration plan
	* defining roles
	* defining mission
	* timeline and dependencies
	* deliverables, who has final say
	* conflict resolution and how to best moderate
	* tools and technical infrastructure
	* time-commitment requirements
* research: multidisciplinary projects are superior for innovation, more universities involved result in few coordination mechanisms and therefore less productivity
* Tools for setting expectations
	* investigation level: "welcome to my team letter"
	* team level: "precollaboration agreement"
	* initiative level: "operating manual"
	* all levels: "collaboration plan"

* 4 phases
	* development phase: brainstorming goals and key processes
	* conceptualization phase: scope is complete, figure out actual question
	* implementation phase: launch conduct and refine the planned TD research
	* translation phase: advance progress along the discovery-development-deliverable pathway
* **TD-net's Toolbox** - Team Science Toolkit
	* CEFP toolbox workshop, Stephen Crowley

## Thursday
### Blog stuff
* literature review of social collaboration
* content and programming
* engagement and team-working
* **project teams** - concetp of structured way to make progress on a work-related project
* plans for next week
* cohort coms plans
* cohort's community guidelines

### Culture - Maddie Grant
* Aligning community management with workplace culture
* **culture**: collection of words, actions, thoughts, and stuff that clarify and reinforce what is truly valued inside an organization
* Trellis - culture->process-> behavior flow
* **community managers** are essentially a single connection point through which we connect an organic dynamic, human system (the online communitiy) with a structured, hierarchical, and impersonal machine (the organization)

## Self-care - Lou Woodley


### Why project teams?


* metrics measurement and evaluation, conflict resolution and go long topics
