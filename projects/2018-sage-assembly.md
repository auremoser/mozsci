### Out in the City - Exploring Counter Indications

Individuals as Data Subjects. We make certain informed assumptions about what it is that people care about, what kind of harms they might experience, and what a good life looks like. We shape ethics policies and technologies and scientific agendas around these assumptions. But how have those assumptions changed now that data analytics is so dominant in our social and industrial landscapes? What does a data subject care about, and how can we treat them with respect?
