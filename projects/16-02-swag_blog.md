SwagMail Kits with Special Guest Science Fox


#BODY

Last week, the Mozilla Science Lab released a preview of special sticker swag featuring our Science Fox, a fab design by [@flukebot](https://github.com/flukeout) on the Foundation design team. We had such overwhelming and awesome response, that we've decided to dispatch some swag packs to our community. Read on to find out more about how you can score a sticker or a swag pack.
