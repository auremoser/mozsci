##tensorflow

### Basics
* open source python library for fast numerical computing, made by goog
* can be used to create deep learning models, direct or via wrapper libs on top of tensor flow lib
* computation is in terms of data flows and the operations/structural build of a directed graph
* **operation** - named abstract computation with I/O attributes
* **tensors** - multi-dimensional arrays of real values
* nodes - perform computation, no I/O, data moves between them as "tensors"


### Cons
* The hard thing about TensorFlow- and DL, AI, etc- is to know what the fuck you are doing
