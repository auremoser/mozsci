####Hive Chicago Buzz 2016 Recap

On January 22-23, 2016, Mozilla’s Hive Chicago Learning Network held its second annual Hive Chicago Buzz at Blue 1647 in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood.  The two-day event included a Friday evening celebration and an day-long hack day on Saturday.  Our goal was simple: to activate solutions to shared challenges in education.

We came together with the belief that improvement in education depends on our ability to work together to create solutions to shared problems. Strong solutions need to be built on strong platforms.  This convening is a place to activate solutions.
