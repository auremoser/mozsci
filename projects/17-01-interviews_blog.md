> "And like one of my...one of the core things about my open science philosophy is that everyone should understand what they're doing so they can make their own choices. Right? So everyone should understand the ramifications when you sign away the licensing of your data to a journal. Right? Or when you are choosing the license to share something, you should understand what it is so that you can make the best choice for you."

Teon to Danielle: "I'll copy it now, then when I hit the stop broadcast, hopefully it doesn't fuck shit up. All right. Bye."

Danielle to Teon: "And so then when I started the fellowship, I was like, oh, wow. This is great...Money."

Danielle on on-campus childcare "it's nice like I'll drop him off and they're like today we're making snowmen with shaving cream and glue and glitter. I'm like have fun with that, guys. I don't really want to do that craft, but I'm glad that someone else is doing this craft that involves shaving cream, glue, and glitter. Good luck. "
