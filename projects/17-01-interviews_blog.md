> "And like one of my...one of the core things about my open science philosophy is that everyone should understand what they're doing so they can make their own choices. Right? So everyone should understand the ramifications when you sign away the licensing of your data to a journal. Right? Or when you are choosing the license to share something, you should understand what it is so that you can make the best choice for you."

FAVE MOMENTS


22 pages - Danielle's interview (Danielle wins for longest interview and best anecdotes)
10 pages - Kirstie's interview (kirstie wins on having an entire page of single spaced text devoted to one of her quotes, and for amazing acronym recall, and for holding down the british front with pluralizing "maths")
10 pages - Teon's interview (Teon wins for a record number of frozen screens and Bruno asking "can you repeat that?")
7 pages - Bruno's interview (bruno wins on having the most professional and articulate answers, not nearly enough "ums" or bad jokes for me to believe he isn't a cylon)


Fave typos

"node extremes" ---> node streams
"hangouts on there" ---> hangouts on air
"I get pay that's commiserate with my skill." --> commensurate?

Teon to Danielle: "I'll copy it now, then when I hit the stop broadcast, hopefully it doesn't fuck shit up. All right. Bye."

Teon to Bruno: "I was at engineering school. Really enjoyed those subjects, but didn't know if I really wanted to be a physicist. I didn't actually know what they did."

"I used to think that going into grad school that industry is bad. Academia is good. They're like the beacon of light and hope. And that's like bullshit."

Teon: "And when I went on a tour of NYU...There are EEGs all over the place. There are eye trackers. Just like basically it was like going into a toy store for academics...they sold us on like all the things that we wanted to hear...You can get to work with epileptic patients if you want to. They make it sound so easy and then shit like never happens. "

"A person has to be going through epileptic seizures, and it's not something that you wish upon people, but that's the only way you get a source of data."

"So my experience with programming is that it's the thankless thing. The thankless skill that you have to have"

Bruno to Teon: "Do you think programming contributions get the deserved credit?

TB: 	I do think that they deserve credit.

BV: 	No. Do you think that they get the deserved credit?

TB: 	Oh, no."

Danielle to Teon: "And so then when I started the fellowship, I was like, oh, wow. This is great...Money."

Danielle on on-campus childcare "it's nice like I'll drop him off and they're like today we're making snowmen with shaving cream and glue and glitter. I'm like have fun with that, guys. I don't really want to do that craft, but I'm glad that someone else is doing this craft that involves shaving cream, glue, and glitter. Good luck. "

Kirstie to Bruno : "I think when I was interviewed I talked and talked and talked and the time went sort of fast. You were much more concise and sensible. This is going to be so much easier to edit than my interview. They're just going to be like, oh, I can just use the transcript and it will totally make sense."

Danielle to Kirstie: "what was the other project called? The ABIDE project?""
K. Whitaker: 	Yeah. So I can't remember what it stands for.
D. Robinson: 	That's okay.
K W: [undetectable] autism.""

Danielle: "Okay. What do you see as a blockers...[child enters] don't worry about it. He's just had...his movie ended. "

Kirstie: "Yeah. So what I want to do with my career is currently really unpopular, although it's becoming more unpopular."
