#### Data Management Ideas

**4/4/16**

##### INSPIRATION

Here are some interactives that demonstrate what can be done in the curriculum and interactive engagement spaces.

**CURRICULUM**

* [CartoDB Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/)
* [Visual introduction to machine learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
* [Visual introduction to Gestalt principles](http://emeeks.github.io/gestaltdataviz/section1.html)
* [Visual introduction to Chef (could be a scroll-like graphic)](http://www.mynameiskate.com/visual-guide-to-chef/) 
* Joey's scroll-splainer, might be an interesting application to these curricula

**JOURNALISM**

* [What is code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
* [Database of the Dead](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

**QUICK/QUIRKY**

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016)
* [Data Sonification](http://listen.hatnote.com/)

##### COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

Here are some examples of what kind of tools and services currently treat the broad topic of "open data" and "data management."

* [Open Source Data Science Masters](http://datasciencemasters.org/) - pretty awesome curriculum on Github
* [Open Syllabus Project](http://opensyllabusproject.org/) - really like the ethos of this initiative
* [Data Privacy Project](http://www.dataprivacyproject.org/)
* [Open Data Tools Index](http://opendata-tools.org/en/)
* [CKAN: Open Source Data Portal](http://ckan.org/)
* [Linked Data Tools List](http://linkeddata.org/tools)


##### (A MODEST) PROPOSAL

We build a pilot of the primer materials as an interactive tutorial 

**CONSTRAINTS**

* *interactive* - I dig the ease of consumption for the Encryption awareness campaign videos, but it would be nice if this had a format that was a bit more self-directed, making the patron less of a consumer more of a coordinator of the content
* *editable and easy for our team* - gh-pages + jekyll
* *scaleable* - a format that can be copied for more curriculum beyond the primer (hope page with index of lessons)

**GOALS**

* build a series of primers exercises and handouts to educate patrons on open data
* provide multiple modes/methods of engagement
* build an open and expandable curriculum
* engage the community in development and grooming of the curriculum
