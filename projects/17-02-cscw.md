[Hack workshop Slack](https://hackathonworkshop.slack.com/messages/general/)

## Intros

* vega person
* galaxy for bioninfromatics - montpellier (june 24-25th) hackathon gcc2017.sciencesconf.org - 2days, structures is really open
* chris holgraf - docathon
* brooke - working on culutural heritage institutions, what about nypl labs crowdsourcing tools, wikipedia editathon
* ML package from Semantech - GsoG students


###Typology of Hackathon-Type Events

* ethnographers embedded in Data Science Environment at UW - MSDSE
* focused on advancing data scienc development
	* communal hackathons (disciplinary hackweeks), contributive hackathon (scoial good data dives), catalytic hackathons (civic hackathons)

* how do my experiences fit inot this model?

###Community & Code: Lessons from NESCent Hackathons

* Arlin
* National Evolutionary Sythesis Center
* open science practices left a record, 9 events surveyed - Evolutionary informatics
* 54 projects/teams
	* mostly produce new code respositories, additions to existing codebases
* by the end of the first day, facilitated process to form teams

###CSCW - Eliminate Hackathons
* internal problem solving evnts for large tech companies

### Building Something Amazing: 4 years of Ohio State's Hackathon Program

* OHI/O hack.osu.edu
* 12 months - secure location, crecruite team
* 6 months - recruit sponsors
...
* weekly meetings ramping up and invest in communication
* color coordinated shirts
* persona based design - 
	* participant experience
	* vip experience
	* sponsor experience
	* judges experience
* prepare emergency plan
	* call lists for emergencies
	* rills
* engaging with alumni
	* swag assembly, food setup
	* post-event survey design

### BoF - Diversity/Inclusion/Remote/Naming

* Remote participation - not a lot of people have experience with this, skyping groups in has worked for some, no functional purpose (slack and twitter solve a lot of communication needs)
* presence is something that's hard to ensure and gauge
* seems like there's different levels (whole teams/someone who is isolated) - satellite hackathon (Idaho) vs (east coast contributors)
* having a hierarchy of roles, who is on call at certain times
* wikimedia has done a few of these kinds of events - wikiresearch hackathon, one person was remote, dedicated mentor who just worked with that person
* data rescue event was at two buildings on campus, used slack for participants to coordinate
* Ryan - GSoC - students don't want to admit failure so we have to lay out expectations on IRC, model after a lot of distributed teams and remote works principles
* creating a catchment systems, people hit a wall at a certain point
* Grace Hopper event, 5 to 1 student:mentor setup was really agreeable for noticing subtlties 
* people feel more frustrated faster if they are "behind" participants, much more likely to feel like I don't below, try to make sure people are coming at the same level
* define the purpose of the event: to teach or to learn
* try to model basic questions so that people feel comfortable
* if it's a hackathon, do I want to go - > Sprint
* [alex](https://github.com/wooorm/alex)
* code jam/fest/hackday, lower the barrier to entry by adding a paragraph to explain what the event

###Democratizing Data Science - University of Washington
* going since 2014
* dharma Dailey, Jonathan T. Morgan
* wiki.communitydata.cc/CDSW
* end user and conversational data scientists - we want to empower people to access and explore their personal data (eg from social media)
* create problem solvers not programmers




* science hackday and space apps
* githugs to encourage continuous contribution
