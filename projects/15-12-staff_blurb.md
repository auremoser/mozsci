Aurelia is a web developer and scientist building communities around code for the Mozilla Science Lab. Her past work at CartoDB, Ushahidi + Internews Kenya, creative tech agencies in New York and academic/art labs in the Midwest built a background that can probably best be described as varied and a bit of a departure from her formal education. Academically, she studied art and chemistry and wrote her grad thesis on preserving/restoring born digital art projects which brought her progressively closer to code and communication on the open web. She's dabbled in the library world as a preservation lab tech, in the journalism world as a former Mozilla OpenNews fellow, in the education and advocacy world as a chapter leader for Girl Develop It and a programming professor at Parson's Journalism school, and in the creative tech space as a tinkerer, a data viz artist, and a generally hungry human for intellectual calisthenics and development.

Outside of professional pursuits, she likes contributing to small collaborative programs with friends like Biononymous, the Recompiler, and her semweb-themed radio show, Stereo Semantics. She gives talks to support all of these side-projects under the umbrella of creative inquiry and experimentation, and sometimes in the names of music, sensor networks, stylesheets, time travel, and privacy/security art. Ask her about living abroad, yoga + reiki practice, french/spanish conversation, or anything related to code, community, and cartography. You can find her @auremoser on twitter, auremoser on github or via her infrequently updated website: http://algorhyth.ms/.
