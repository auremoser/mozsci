## MSL on the Road: Nairobi + iHub Data Jam
better : https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/nairobi-fellows-blog

This past week, the Mozilla Science Lab and fellows spent their final workweek before the close of their fellowships in Kenya. We dug into their fellowship program and wrap-up proceedings, met awesome people in our pan-african network, and gave some pretty cool guest lectures at co-working and research spaces throughout Nairobi. Here's a brief run-down of what we were up to, and where we might go with the future fellows' cohorts.


### Places + Spaces

One of our fellows, Richard Smith-Unna recently relocated to Kenya from Cambridge, UK, and we joined him from July 26th through August 3rd to pitch in during the iHub Data Camp (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6_ZVUFx2WHHaUpSQXVZa2N4ZzA1d3FxOXdBNlRjb19nSEQ4/view?usp=sharing) and spend a last week together before we onboard a new fellows cohort in September ! You can review our itinerary and plans for the week here (https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/nairobi-fellows-jam), but we'll tease out some highlights below for those who would rather follow along.

* iHub
* IBM Research
* Brackenhurst - a retreat center, tea plantation and expansive botanical garden outside Nairobi, where we 

### Progress

In addition to meetups with the awesome open source/science presence in East Africa, we also made progress on some concluding exercises for our fellows. Each of our four current fellows went over their final to-dos for unfinished projects, assembled a short résumé of all recent tasks, and had the opportunity to crowdsource testing with co-fellows of materials they've developed so far.

In no particular order, here are some updates from our stellar fellows:

* Christie - solicited fellows' feedback on Research Quantitative Methods (RQM), a more general course and instructor manual on using, processing, and analyzing other people's data in the spirit of open science. We reviewed her outline and instructor manual, and build a small template for the RQM.

Read her résumé here, and reach out to her on Twitter here; she'll be continuing her post-doc in another lab at the University of Michigan.

* Jason - organized a workshop (https://github.com/jasonbobe/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/PMI-workshop-nairobi.md) on principles of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) a project with support from the US Presidency to establish guidelines for ethical and open data sharing, documentation, and transparency for biomedical research. We work on translating the principles to human-readable terms and discussing how these principles might evolve to more informed consent procedures for research participants.

Read his résumé here (https://github.com/jasonbobe/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/resume.md), and reach out to him on Twitter here; he'll be continuing his work on the Resilience Project into the next year.

* Joey - outlined his remaining projects and prototypes and broke them down into features, he also designed a great rubric for evaluating engagement and participation in fellowship programs, totally extensible to mentorship or educational models as well. 


Read his résumé here, and reach out to him on Twitter here; he'll be working on open mobility tech-xperiments in Germany with the developers at Moovil.

* Richard -  welcomed us to Brackenhurst and Nairobi, helping with on-the-ground logistics and side-adventures; he connected with the contacts we visited in Nairobi and particularly with Amel and h3abionet, the pan-african bioinformatics network on behalf of which he's conducted bioinformatics trainings in Khartoum and Nairobi throughout his fellowship. These trainings inspired his work on the Command Line Bootcamp and subsequent collaboration with Joey to develop a Bootcamp for Geo. 

Read his résumé here, and reach out to him on Twitter here; he'll be working remotely at the Coko Foundation out of Kenya.


We'll revisit these in our Community Call this coming week -- August 11th, 11am -- tune in to learn more about the geospatial sciences and open source tools for web cartography



### People + Projects

Special thanks goes out to the amazing folks we met on our visit, detailed below with twitter contacts so you can reach out to them as well:
