### Details

The Future of Mozilla Fellowships 

2018 onwards we are trying to consolidate our fellowships. What should fellowships look like in 2018 - so that they enrich and strengthen our network with communities of practice in areas of our focus

To explore ideas that people across the team might have about fellowships, what they have meant in the past, and what they should mean going forward. Also an opportunity to get thoughts on what has worked in other (outside of MoFo) fellowship programs that can inform our model
To plan for action: at the end of the session, we would have defined milestones, next steps and/or deliverables for the fellowship redesign project

### Instructions

Thanks so much for facilitating one or more OKR 4 (Launch the Network) Working Sessions at All Hands! You can see all the sessions at http://mzl.la/workingsessions. 
 
Below are some suggested guidelines to consider as you plan your sessions, and we also recommend reviewing these facilitation tips from FabRiders, which we also share with MozFest facilitators.  
 
You are responsible for making sure your session is documented.
Documentation will happen in a shared Google deck. Below you’ll see the template for session “results.” (Screenshot at the bottom of this email) Copy and paste that slide beneath the slide with your session description. 
Ask for a volunteer in your session to take notes or document in real-time if possible. There will also be time on Friday before lunch to make sure we’ve captured pertinent info in the deck. 
Most important things to document: New or updated activities related to an OKR, new discoveries, decisions and next steps.
Remember, you may not have every single person you’d like to have in your session, which is why the “results” slide will be important. It will help people who missed the session catch up, understand what the next steps are and figure out how best to plug in after All Hands. 
 
Design for inclusivity in the first few minutes of your session.
We have many new MoFo’s since our last All Hands, as well as some invited guests (fellows, consultants) and possibly some MoCo participants as well. 
Sessions are all 90 minutes - be sure to program time at the beginning to:
Do quick introductions
Briefly establish participation norms, such as active listening, 50% rule, agree to disagree respectfully, invite clarifying questions,etc.
Break up into smaller groups when you have larger groups and/or you have various versions of the discussion that would benefit from smaller conversations..
Ask for documentation/timekeeping volunteers
Reiterate what the session goals are
Help people get on the same page by sharing some key points about what people should know about work that’s already happened or what we’ve already learned
Note if there are specific things we still need to work through or make decisions on
 
Less is more. Try to do a small number of things well in your session, rather than cramming in too many elements. Have a clear purpose, state the desired outcome, and check along the way that you’re progressing towards those goals. 
Consider using the POP framework: Purpose, Outcomes, Process
Watch for tangents that de-focus the topic at hand; gently rope in those who digress or veer off topic. Similarly, don’t let participants get too fixated on one point.
It’s also ok to break into small groups to tackle more granular details. Those should also be documented as emergent sessions in the Google deck. 
 
Before the end of the session:
Leave 5-10 minutes to summarize what has been covered and accomplished.
Try to agree on 2-3 key takeaways that summarize the sessions for those reading the notes later.
Agree on next steps or action items and who will be responsible.
Consider how the facilitator and session participants can help carry the work forward after All Hands, e.g., setting up a follow-up meeting, inviting others to participate or contribute, etc.
If there’s time, consider a quick “pluses/deltas” go around to evaluate the session.
 
Please feel free to share this with your co-facilitators, and feel free to contact me with any questions.
 
We look forward to engaging, participatory and inclusive working sessions throughout the week. Thank you for stepping up as facilitators to push our strategy forward and lead us towards increasing impact in the second half of the year!
 
Best,
Rizwan
