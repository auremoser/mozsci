Quick check in about metrics projects.

Background
=========
* ORG CHART - Firefox
* statisticians/data science types, assigned to work for specific product area, add-ons, search, desktop - one person per product
* low-level pickup descriptive statistics
* visualization guy just left - technical visualization type work
* 1-2 year strategy, product managers need answers, that's the purpose of the team
* engineers on platform, application engineers that work on firefox platform, and product (where this team is)
* this team doesn't just do dashboards, what would it look like if mozilla worked on products related to data 
* legal and policy stuff to get through but trying to explore data on add-ons, recommendation engine that recommends add-ons to client
* more of these public-facing things that our team is working on...we can collect certain types of data that no-one else can....going more and more public, public goods around data, PEW for example produces a lot of data

Lookup - firefox hardware report (what is the gpu platform of the web) - format?

opt out by default?
internet health report

maps have a great potential for usability and anonymity

privacy survey - ask people about what they prefer
about:telemetry
- geo:id (mls/google) not locale where download the binary
- which countries have shittier computers
- harsh truths about internet
- how do we empower users to care about isps and net neutrality - passive measurement and feedback of payload times, some metadata - semantic web sidebar - can only test when a large binary is being transfered (download firefox for accurate speed tests)
- sem web side-bar with stats, client-level diagnostic data
about: healthreport
about: telemetry
- what does it mean to use a browser, time count or specific interactions?
- user profiles (user, author...)

- hash the mac address pings

- who else is online?
- spurious correlations - bivariate choropleth maps
   - voter turnout police violence

We can take notes in this invite and share ideas about Metrics + Mozilla Science. Feel free to move the event around. 

Followup
=======
- internet health report collab - firefoxish data
- check out about:healthreport / about:telemetry - not real time (delays) event telemetry might give you some more real time but it's future stuff
- within a day
- people disappear if they stop using firefox --- need better pings for different states of the browser is a work in progress
- concept of a session is very hard, a little confusing, never close down and doesn't crash

Ideas
=====
- what the hell happened today? - for the web
- tabs vs windows opened - firefox add-on --containers project maybe
- nice json for coordinates and covariate space for IHR
- internet qual data but that requires working with firefox team because needs to be rolled into binary - already in firefox, what was the avg download quality in this area/town
- Internet Census  - internet quality around the world
