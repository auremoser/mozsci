### FLUXX NOTES

* watched Kalpana's [Fluxx video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B7FKQQVpUabKTmYyZnNwZGFTdmc)

#### Notes on video

**Pluses**

* nice that they integrate reports into the application process to solicit checkins from fellows and set expectations
* application is very similar to screendoor and has document upload, as well as reactive fields that pop up based on answers
* "cards" are different requests that you receive in Fluxx, lists of records, pan right to left/left to right; can create separate "dashboards" of cards based on fellowships - individual workspaces, could possibly coordinate them on a per-reviewer basis (called "templates") that you can share with people individually
* allows you to connect records (so past applicants' profiles could be linked at the time of eligibility request)
* workflow status can be defined (elibility, application review, first interview, Internal review, second interview, advisors interview) and applications triaged accordingly
* lots of drill down options to see linked organizations and affiliations, might be good for matching fellows to host orgs if required
* key stats about requests can be pulled up with one click, no manual stats collection, filter and query options are pretty impressive
* also allows for funding triage, and breakdown of how much they've used, which would be useful for negotiating expenses with Alexei
* mail merge functionality for template emails is nice
* external review process is solid, you define their entry point into the review process, their role, and provide a form for feedback. 
* can do federated filter for applications in certain program areas accross all cards in a dashboard, would be useful for fellow triage to appropriate program
* nice map view, spreadsheet view, and stats views for assessing coverage of application pool, also pulls stats on how long each stage takes, so we can assess the efficiency of the review process
* can share "snapshots" of filters will colleagues
* can do automated "graphing" and visualizations of cards, good for funder reports, advisor/host org updates, and blog/newsletter, D3 visualizations on filter demand
* excel plugin would let us use our excel/gsheets templates for fellowship review

**Minuses**

* seems like cards could get unwieldly, lots of potential to create cards and forget to manage them, or create dashboards...will need some restraint
* functionality in fluxx is solid, but the interface feels a bit dated, is the public-facing UI more updated, and customizable to match our brand and website?
* our goal for the unified fellowship was to make the application process more seemless, sync timelines for application launch, and allow for cross-org awareness and management of stats so that redundancy is minimal and we match our funds to the most eligible candidates for each fellowship. Thus far though, we have two fellowship applications and the cross-over between applicants is agreeable but maybe not so intense that it can't be manually arranged. Before we proceed with a process overhaul, we should probably decide if we will build capacity in the next few years to need this kind of specialized framework
