This past week, the American Association for the Advancement of the Sciences (AAAS, pronounced "triple-A S") hosted 20 fellows for an orientation to Community Engagement, an effort to professionalize and institutionalize practices for scientific community managers. The attendees came from all sectors of scientific study, most with a background in scientific research and a growing task list of events, programs, projects and intitiatives for furthering scientific study and collaboration. The Mozilla Science Lab was there in support, running workshops on open science and community development through code of conduct development. Here's some of the cool things that happened, and ways you can engage with these fellows!


### The Program

> **community managers** are essentially a single connection point through which we connect an organic dynamic, human system (the online communitiy) with a structured, hierarchical, and impersonal machine (the organization)

AAAS's Community Engagement Fellowship Program is a 6-month mentorship opportunity to develop skills in managing scientific communities. In this pilot year, they've recruited 20 C4Sci (Community for Science) fellows currently running independent communities to build presence on Trellis, their platform for conversation and collaboration across scientific programs. Trellis hosts 95,000 members from the AAAS network, and the fellows are among a cohort hoping to onboard even more community to the beta platform.

For this week, each fellow contributed lightning talk introductions to their community and their challenges, and supportive sessions were structured around community development, content and communication, and culture change. Guests, like the Mozilla Science Lab, were invited to punctuate these discussions with research insights from outside communities, including:

* Community Roundtable - an organization that conducts annual surveys across scientific communities and assesses the landscape of experience and challenges that affect community organization in the sciences through semi-annual reports.
* Science for Team Science - 
* TD-net's Toolbox Initiative - 


### Mentorship as a Model

Much of the week was structured around mentorship opportunites, like the Open Leadership Training series that Mozilla developed. Each afternoon, small groups of fellows would reinuite with the same mentor to talk through the day's learnings and share resources for follow-up. These consistent opportunities to check-in on the utility of agenda items allowed the week to develop and change organically, focusing on what fellows' needed and less on a static agenda. 

Independent of the size, geographic constraints and disciplinary focus of each fellows' community related to the content of the workweek in multiple ways. We began and closed the week with small group discussion and dynamics exercises, to help all recognize the different communication styles and boundaries of the other cohort members. From this, we drafted a succinct set of community guidelines here, forkable and shareable for anyone attempting to unite their community around a key mission and code of conduct:

You can find these exercises and resources on this [site]() and in this [repository on Github](). We copied the final set of community guidelines here, though it's important to note that these were the result of multiple drafts and dynamic discussion on what this particular cohort wanted to guide their work for the duration of their fellowship.
