Bio:
An applied statistics PhD-candidate at Tilburg University, as part of the Metaresearch group. He has contributed to open science projects such as the Reproducibility Project: Psychology, tries to develop open-source software for scientists, and does research on detecting data fabrication in science. He is particularly interested in how the scholarly system can be adapted to become sustainable, healthy scholarly environment with permissive use of content, which also aligns the needs of science and scientists instead of creating a perverse system that promotes unreliable science. He initiated Liberate Science to work towards such a system.
