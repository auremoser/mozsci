#### TITLE

A Scientific Method: building science scripting tools for a web-wide world

#### SUMMARY
The scientific method centers around reproducibility, a set of steps and standards that have their echoes in our web-world today: reproducibility, methodical logic, testing and retesting. Sometimes we ignore these principles, in science and in scripting, but the standards they reinforce still influence how we evolve the web, and this talk will be about sharing some of what we know in science software with the wider world online.

At the Mozilla Science Lab, we build open science projects and programs to support scientists who want to open source their research materials...that means open data, open research findings, accessible retractions, open access publications. We do a ton of this in Javascript, and use JS/Jekyll/React to power our templated toolkits for building curriculum and workshops that hold science to an open source methodology, and keep the web healthy, informed, and diverse...for people, not profit. This talk will share some of our template materials, how we build citizen science and feedback into everyone of our initiatives and how you can get involved or apply for our support to fund your own research initiatives on the free web.


#### RELEVANCE
Mozilla has a ton of opportunities to support open source developers and projects in the physical/natural/life/computer/social sciences. It surprises people that scientific research is too often siloed in proprietary licensing and closed academic institutions without respect to the scientific method and the open knowledge ethos that we'd all like to apply to learning. Further, there's a lot that the JS community can bring to the sciences: improving interfaces to biomedical research studies, providing public indices of papers, citation networks, and research data...there are so many opportunities for devs to get involved in open science research that saves lives, stems disease, charts the cartography of our cosmos, and helps us learn about the world...I think anyone would be excited about learning more about that.

#### BIO

Aurelia is a developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at Mozilla Science Lab. She volunteers as a Chapter Leader for the NYC Girl Develop It, teaches data visualization at the School of Visual Art, and writes about geospatial design and development. She's been working in the open tech and non-profit research space for a few years, and recent projects have had mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South.
