Spoofing Bio-Surveillance: Practices to protect your bioprivacy

####SUMMARY

On the web, digital privacy and cyber secu often displaces concern for the protection of personal and physical security. With the increasing conflation of touchID fingerprint passwords and the bio-authentication with our technological applications and devices, it seems increasingly important to consider how the compromise of your bio-information could devastate more than a typical password leak or stolen credit card. Your personal privacy is more at risk now that biological information ties closely with online identity. How do you protect this information, how might you spoof your bio trail from leak, copy, or misuse by third parties, what approaches to protecting your dna and genomic data might we provide to this masses?

This session is meant to review some approaches: legal, medical, artistic/fantastic, to the protection of your bio-information. We'll crowdsource ideas and compile them into an online guide for using clever channels for bio-nonymous interaction online.
