Pro-pattern making: let's compose a set of design guidelines for clear and crisp news

####SUMMARY

Working with code in organizations is a trade, involving craftsmanship and careful curation of content to build bold and clear narratives. Style guides and design patterns give us some frameworks for crafting simple, repeatable, and structured projects; likewise by committing to a pattern, we can forecast the utility of a project or interactive, and easily solicit contributions toward a more evolved and better-tested model for design. Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a "plain" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disiplines, and projects. Maybe we can submit them as an IRE tipsheet: https://www.ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=newsrooms&page=2
