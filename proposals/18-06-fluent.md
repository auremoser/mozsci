#### TITLE
you are [w]here?: geospatial web dev off the beaten <map>

#### DESCRIPTION
The meaning of "map" across disciplines is remarkably varied. It's effectively a spatial representation of geo-topography, a linking between tables by foreign key, a datatype in C++... Today, coders make creative use of custom basemaps and clever scripting methods, building remarkable maps of multivariate information off-the-(beaten) geographic projection. Many have designed and published interactive maps of cemetery burial plots, galactic drawings of the Star Wars Universe, sequence maps of human genes, heatmaps of court traffic during the NBA finals, fantasy landscapes from deeply fake stats.

Focusing on a mix of artificial, scientific, and environmental sensing data, we'll characterize fantasy and farcical mapping, teasing out the tough parts of geocoding on real and mythical spatial matrices, while delving into the contrived topographies of null island, paper towns, "dumb" cities, and the infinitely curious world of geo-speculative design in JS.
